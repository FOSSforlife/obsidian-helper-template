These are just examples, and will not necessarily match your schema! Copy these and modify as needed.

If your schemas are large, one trick to save time is to copy the YAML frontmatter (accessible either by opening your Markdown files in VSCode, or by using Obsidian's "source mode"), and paste it into the [YAML to JSON tool](https://transform.tools/yaml-to-json), followed by the [JSON to TypeScript interface tool](https://transform.tools/json-to-typescript).
